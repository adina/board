#Handling Funding Leads

Funding leads should be communicated by email directly to the committee head of the Partner Relations / Development Committee (and copied to the Executive Director and Steering Committee) with the term “Funding Lead” in the subject line. The Partner Relations / Development Committee will follow leads and with a protocol dealing with template emails for explaining partnership, how to handle requests for customization, who handles communication with those partners, how to set up the contract, and how to request invoices from NumFOCUS.
