# Workshop Issues and Communications

In the event that you would like to communicate workshop concerns (e.g., a workshop ball gets dropped), there are two options, depending on the need of confidentiality of the situation. For non-confidential concerns, workshop concerns should be communicated directly to the SCF Program Coordinator with “Ball Drop” within the subject line (with the Executive Director copied). For confidential concerns, workshop concerns can be communicated to the SCF ombudsperson at 
confidential@software-carpentry.org. You should expect a response within five days.

Examples of workshop concerns could include:  instructor/helper absence, inappropriate instruction, concerns about hosts, lack of instruction prepration, etc.  You may use either email (to the Program Coordinator or to the ombudsperson) at your own discretion.
